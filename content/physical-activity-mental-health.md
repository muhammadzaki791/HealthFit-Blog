## 1. The Science Behind Exercise and Mental Health

Physical activity triggers various biological processes that directly impact our mental state. When we exercise, our bodies release endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin - often called "feel-good" hormones. These natural chemicals help:

- Reduce stress and anxiety
- Improve mood and emotional regulation
- Enhance cognitive function
- Boost self-esteem and confidence
- Promote better sleep quality

### Key Mental Health Benefits of Regular Exercise

1. **Stress Reduction**: Regular physical activity lowers cortisol levels and helps manage stress more effectively.
2. **Depression Management**: Exercise has been shown to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression in some cases.
3. **Anxiety Relief**: Both aerobic and resistance training can help reduce anxiety symptoms.
4. **Cognitive Enhancement**: Physical activity improves memory, focus, and overall brain function.
